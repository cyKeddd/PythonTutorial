# The specified formats depend on the formatting options supported by the platform and the C library used. However, some common format specifiers used in strftime are:

# %a - abbreviated weekday name
# %A - full weekday name
# %b - abbreviated month name
# %B - full month name
# %c - preferred local date and time representation
# %d - zero-padded day of the month as a decimal number [01,31]
# %H - hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23]
# %I - hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12]
# %m - month as a zero-padded decimal number [01,12]
# %M - minute as a zero-padded decimal number [00,59]
# %p - localeâ€™s equivalent of either AM or PM
# %S - second as a zero-padded decimal number [00,61]
# %U - Sunday as the first day of the week, week number of the year as a decimal number [00,53]
# %w - weekday as a decimal number [0(Sunday),6]
# %W - Monday as the first day of the week, week number of the year as a decimal number [00,53]
# %x - preferred local date representation
# %X - preferred local time representation
# %y - year without century as a zero-padded decimal number [00,99]
# %Y - year with century as a decimal number
# %z - UTC offset in the form +HHMM or -HHMM
# %Z - time zone name
